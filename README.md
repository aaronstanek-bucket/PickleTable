# PickleTable
An interface with Python's Pickle Module. This guarantees a consistent data format.

The using this module allows the user the ability to save and load tables of data from files (using Python's Pickle). This allows the end user to code without worrying about the format of their saved data. This module also type-checks all the information that is passed to it to make asolutely sure that when the data is then loaded by a different program, the new program will not break.

See API.txt for a description of how to use this module.

The files generated by this module always have the extension .pickletable

Every file has spaces for the name and a description of the data saved inside the file

A file may contain any integer number of tables

Each table can have a name, and human readable description attached to it

Every row in every table is constrained to have the same number of columns, this makes is harder to break a program that is reading the .pickletable file

Names and descriptions must always be strings; the module will throw an exception if you try to do something else

Each element in a table must be an int, float, string, or boolean; the module will throw an exception if you try to do something else
