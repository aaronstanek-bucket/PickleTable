  <h2>
    About
  </h2>
  <p>
    PickleTable is a Python Module whose purpose is to guarantee that data is being saved in a desirable and easily usable format.
    In short, it provides an interface with Python's Pickle Module, and checks data format and datatype while saving.
    The files generated and read by this module will always have the extension .pickletable (this is to make it harder to load malformatted data).
    Each file is a collection of 2 dimensional tables. The width of each table must be fixed before any data can be written to the table.
    The entries in each table are constrined to the types: int, float, string, and boolean. The file as a whole, as well as each
    table can have a name and human readable description.
  </p>
  <h2>
    API
  </h2>
  <p>
    The module contains a class called PickleTable. The API for this module is built around specific methods in this class. Making function calls
    to things in the module, but outside the API, may lead to undefined or undesirable behavior.
    <br>
    Each table and PickleTable has a name and a readme. Both are strings and can be set arbitrarily by the user (they have no predetermined purpose). When sending data to
    a PickleTable you will have to keep track of the active table. You can only ever edit the active table. The active table
    is set by the addTable method. (The newest table is always the active one). So, after you create a new table, you
    cannot go back and edit a table that you created previously.
    <br>
    Listed below are the functions that comprise the PickleTable API. All are methods of a PickleTable object, so to use this module,
    you must first create a new PickleTable object, then you must use the methods listed below to modify/query the PickleTable object.

  <b>Saving and Loading</b>
  <table border="3px">
    <tr>
      <td width="200px">
        toFile(filename)
      </td>
      <td>
        This saves a PickleTable object to a file.
        <br>
        The filename specifies where to save the object. This argument must be an string.
        <br>
        The filename must end in ".pickletable"
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        fromFile(filename)
      </td>
      <td>
        This loads a PickleTable object from a file.
        <br>
        The filename specifies where to get the object. This argument must be an string.
        <br>
        The filename must end in ".pickletable"
        <br>
        Note that this operation will overwrite any information that is presently stored in the PickleTable.

  <b>PickleTable level operations</b>
  <table border="3px">
    <tr>
      <td width="200px">
        clear()
      </td>
      <td>
        This method will reset a PickleTable. The name, readme are set to the empty string, and all tables are dropped.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        setName(name)
      </td>
      <td>
        This method will set the name for a file. (Note: this is not the filename, this is a piece of information stored in the file called "name")
        <br>
        The name argument must be a string.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        setReadme(readme)
      </td>
      <td>
        This method will set the name for a file.
        <br>
        The readme argument must be a string.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        getName()
      </td>
      <td>
        This returns the value of the name property of a PickleTable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        getReadme()
      </td>
      <td>
        This returns the value of the readme property of a PickleTable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        getTableCount()
      </td>
      <td>
        This returns the number of tables stored in a PickleTable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        addTable()
      </td>
      <td>
        This adds a new table to a PickleTable. This new table is then set as the active table.

  <b>Table level operations</b>
  <table border="3px">
    <tr>
      <td width="200px">
        setTableName(name)
      </td>
      <td>
        This will set the name of the active table.

        The readme argument must be a string.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        setTableWidth(width)
      </td>
      <td>
        This will set the number of columns in the active table.
        <br>
        It is only possible to use this function if the active table has zero rows. If the table has a nonzero number of rows then an exception will be thrown. You may use getTableRowCount to determine the number of rows in a table, or clear to empty everything.
        <br>
        The width argument must be a int.

  <b>Row level operations</b>
  <table border="3px">
    <tr>
      <td width="200px">

        This will append a row of data to the active table. Row must be a list and must have the correct number of elements.
        The correct number of elements is determined by the active table's width, which must be set before any rows are added.
        If you try to add a row before the width has been set, then an exception will be thrown. The elements of
        the row argument may only be int, float, str, or bool. The type will be check before the information is added to the table.

        get(tindex,rnum)
      </td>
      <td>
        This will return a row of data. tindex is the table index; it specifies from which table you would like information.
        rnum specifies which row in the table you would like.
        <br>
        Both the tindex and rnum arguments must be int.
